#**User Behavior Analysis for Content Recommendation**#
**Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing user behavior to create personalized content recommendations. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance user engagement and satisfaction through precise recommendations.

**Key Highlights**
Preprocessed and cleaned 5 datasets to create a unified data structure for analysis.
Implemented a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based recommendation system to predict user preferences.
Fine-tuned evaluation metrics, including precision and recall, to improve accuracy and content prioritization.
Problem Statement
Understanding user behavior is crucial for modern platforms to offer personalized experiences. This project identifies patterns in interaction data and utilizes them to predict user preferences, enabling better content delivery strategies.

**Dataset**
The project uses interaction data consisting of:

5 datasets merged into a single table.
A maximum of 12,000 rows in the primary dataset.
Features include user IDs, content IDs, interaction types (clicks, views, likes), and timestamps.

Technologies Used
Python: Data preprocessing and analysis.
Pandas & NumPy: Data cleaning and transformation.
Scikit-Learn: Model development (SVD implementation).
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Development environment.
Key Steps
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and anomalies in interaction data.
Normalized and merged datasets into a cohesive format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified user behavior patterns and content engagement trends.
Visualized interaction distributions using histograms and heatmaps.
Model Development

Utilized SVD to factorize the user-item interaction matrix.
Predicted user preferences for unseen content.
Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and RMSE.
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize accuracy and user satisfaction.
Results
Achieved a high level of recommendation accuracy with improved precision and recall scores.
Delivered personalized recommendations that aligned closely with user preferences.
Future Scope
Incorporate real-time user interaction updates to enhance recommendation adaptability.
Experiment with deep learning models like Autoencoders for improved performance.
Extend the project to include a content-based filtering module for hybrid recommendations.
